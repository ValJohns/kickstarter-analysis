# Kickstarter Analysis - Theater & Plays 

## A more indepth analysis regarding play campaigns based on launched and goals

### The purpose of this analysis is to detect and analyze what time and campaign factor would result in successful campaign outcome. 

## **Analysis and Challenges**

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date*

-When concluding this analysis based on launched date, I first started by first converting the launched at data (column J) and displaying the conversion in the "Date Created conversion" (Column S) which is formatted in MM/DD/YYYY format to be read easily. To extract the data that we are solely looking for I made a pivot table where I was about to filter all the outcomes (successful, failed and canceled), along with parent category of the campaigns and by year.

I personally did not experience any challenge while producing this data and chart but one may have an issue with the date conversion since that portion is large portion of specific analysis.. 

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals*
-When concluding the analysis regarding outcomes based on goal the process was much different from previous analysis. First, I composed a new chart and including the virtual data need to assist with this visualization such as the number of different outcomes, the total project amount, and percentages and of course the goal based on five-thousand-dollar increments. This information was based on the subcategory of "Plays".

Although I did not experience any hardship while completing the goal-based analysis it could be viewed as more tedious based of the formulas used for the ranges and the formula can be easily transposed also. 


### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

## **Results**

- I can make multiple conclusions based on the result I derived from the Launch date-based analysis but the two that most striking are: the best time to launch a play campaign would be in the month of May and the worst time to launched would be in December. Even though May also had the most failed campaigned the amount of successful one almost double that amount.

- I would conclude that the most successful goal were campaigns that had goals between $0-$4999.00. Both goal ranges that include those dollars amount obtained the highest percentage goal in their respective ranges.

- The limitation that we must keep in mind are that this was based on the categories on Theater and plays.

- â€¢	Although the line chart was the best choice to capture the request data, a clustered bar chart may have also been a visualization option.
